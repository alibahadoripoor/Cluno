# Cluno
This is a sample application for getting a list of Cluno's Offer Portfolios from the server and showing them.

The Cluno app is written with Swift programming language, MVVM Design Pattern, HTTP REST API, and by using Cocoapods as a Dependency Manager.
The frameworks that have been used in this application included: SwiftUI, Combine, XCTest, Kingfisher, etc.

## Implementation
In the main view, we can see a list of Cluno's Offer Portfolios.

By selecting every offer we will move to the Offer Details view, where we can see and chose the related prices.

## Run
To run please open `Cluno.xcworkspace` chose device or simulator and run.
I've kept `Pods` directory to remove the hassle with pod installation etc.

## Requirements
- XCode 12
- Swift 5
- Cocoapods
